# requirements.txt

# This project primarily uses the Python standard library.
# The following package is optional but *required* for the 'tiktoken' mode,
# which provides accurate tokenization for OpenAI LLMs (like GPT-4).
# If you only need basic regex-based splitting, you don't need to install this.

# To install: pip install tiktoken
# tiktoken>=0.4.0
